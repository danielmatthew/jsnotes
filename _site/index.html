    </h2>
    <h3>Function declaration</h3>

<p>A function declaration is written like so:</p>

<pre><code>function example() {}
</code></pre>

<p>A declared function is evaluated at parse-time - when the browser's Javascript engine gives it the once-over to see what it contains - and thus are loaded before any code is executed.
In practical terms, this function can now be called at anytime: perhaps in code that is defined before the function. This is due to the idea of hoisting: a facet of the language that allows variables to be 'hoisted' to the top of the scope in which it is defined, regardless of where it's placed. As it happens, a variable is created with the same name as the function.</p>

<h3>Function expression</h3>

<p>A function expression looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var example = function() {}
</code></pre>

<p>This kind of function is evaluated at run-time and means that <code>example()</code> can't be called until the JS engine has reached that point in your code. If it's referenced before that, you'll get an error.</p>

<p>In reality, they're incredibly similar functionality wise. Just make sure you're aware of how the Javascript interpreter is going to load them.</p>

<h3>Function constructor</h3>

<p>This is a concept that was new to me before writing this - so perhaps the self-documentation idea does have merits!
It is possible to write:</p>

<pre><code>var example = new Function() {}
</code></pre>

<p>However, Mozilla's Developer Network advises against this approach because:</p>

<blockquote><p>it needs the function body as a string, which may prevent optimizations</p></blockquote>

<p>In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Douglas Crockford recommends that JS authors use function expressions because</p>

<blockquote><p>it makes it clear <em>foo</em> is a variable containing a function value. It is important to understand that functions are values.</p></blockquote>

<p>Coming from a 'traditional' Computer Science background, I was initially more comfortable with function declarations. In practice, I prefer the aesthetics of the function expression: it improves legibility no end.</p>

<p>A few things to bear in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>A function name cannot be changed, but a variable to which a function is assigned <em>can</em> be reassigned.</li>
<li>The function name can only be used within the function's body.</li>
</ul>
